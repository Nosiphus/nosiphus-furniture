When MrCrayFish upgraded the Furniture Mod from 1.12.2 to 1.16.5, he decided to take the mod in a new direction, and part of that direction meant leaving behind some of the older furniture. With his blessing, I have created an addon to readd some of that furniture. I have also extended these blocks to more closely follow certain changes the main mod has made.

As a disclaimer, as the main mod receives updates, it is possible that I will remove certain blocks from this mod if they reappear in the main mod.
