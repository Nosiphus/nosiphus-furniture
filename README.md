# nosiphus-furniture-mod
Nosiphus Furniture Mod is an addon to MrCrayFish's Furniture Mod that restores furniture from earlier versions of the mod that have been removed, as well as expanding on some of those older blocks to fit in better with the current mod.

Name change under consideration, waiting on approval.
